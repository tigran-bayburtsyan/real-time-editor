# About
This repository is for http://devclub.am blog post which is describing how to create simple combination of JavaScript frontend AngularJS and server side Express.js + Socket.io Node.js projects.

# Run This Example
You need to have installed <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>.
<b>After installing Node.js</b> just run this commands
<pre>
    git clone https://github.com/tigran-bayburtsyan/real-time-editor.git
    cd real-time-editor
    npm install
    node server.js
</pre>

<p>
    You will have running server on port 3000, so you can open web browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.
</p>

# For testing
<p>
    Type document name in input field and hit enter. Open another tab, type same document name and press enter.
</p>
<p>
    Now your documents are connected, type something in document text and you will see same text on another tab :)
